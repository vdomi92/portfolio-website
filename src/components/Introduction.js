          I'm looking for a position where I can work on interesting projects
          with the latest technologies so I can grow as a person and developer.
          Some of the technologies I have experience with is HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, ReactJS, Bootstrap, but I'm more than happy to learn
          anything new. Most of the knowledge from the previously listed tech is
          self-taught. During my education I've learned MySQL, C#, PHP and also
          a glimpse of JavaScript which made me fell in love with it, that's why
          i chose to pursue it on my own too.
